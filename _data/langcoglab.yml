         Kat completed her PhD in developmental psychology at NYU in the Steinhardt School of Culture, 
         Education, and Human Development. She broadly studies how young children adapt their attention
         and learning behaviors to best match different early environments, with particular focus on 
         understanding variability and strengths in contexts of early adversity. A key aim of her 
         research is to create and collaborate on innovative uses of technology and statistical 
         methods to support education and developmental science.

         Rebecca received her B.Sc. from the University of Toronto and her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley.  
         Her research program investigates when and how children learn about - and consequently 
         learn from - symbolic systems, such as language and pictures. Specifically, her
         postdoctoral work investigates the development of picture comprehension across 
         cultures and contexts.
